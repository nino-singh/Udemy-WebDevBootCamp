	<h2>Using Div</h2>
	<p>A div is a container that allows you to group text or images and if you had a background, it would be the size of your grouped text. Its more useful when used with CSS that has the visual styling. A div is a block level element</p>
	<p>A span is also a container but its an inline container. So anything in this container can have visual styling applied to it. Again, more useful when you have CSS with it.</p>


	<p>Attributes are decriptive pieces of info you can add to a tag. Such as an image tag where you specify the src address of where to get the image. <img src=https://assets.blog.slice.ca/imageserve/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/09/golden-cocker-retriever-e1506543125624/x.jpg></p>

	<p>An anchor tag allows you to provide a text based link on your page to go somewhere else. You must be explicit in specifying what protocol you are using if its on the web, you use https, or if its another web page on your site, it defaults to using the file protocol. <a href="https://www.google.com">Click me to go to google</a></p>

	<p>To link to another of your own web pages, you can explicitly use the file protocol with the file path to where the next page is located.
